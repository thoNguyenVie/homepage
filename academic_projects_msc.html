            <p style="MARGIN: 0px 16px 0px">Photogrammetry, a measurement method raised from geodesy, has been developed with its complete theory 
since nineteenth century for the early purpose of exactly determining any coordinate in space. Computer vision, even its later appearance in 1970s, can be characterised as a flexible branch of artificial intelligence and robot vision. The combination of photogrammetry and computer vision has created many new applications in human's life due to its excellent properties such as exactitude, fastness, robustness and inexpensiveness.</p><br>

			<p style="MARGIN: 0px 16px 0px">Conventional scene reconstruction algorithms require the use of calibration artefacts to recover camera information (including camera parameters (intrinsic) and poses (extrinsic)), from which a 3-D point cloud of the real scene will be reconstructed. Those calibration artifacts should indeed have their dimensions relatively as big as the real scene/object, which sometimes not easy to prepare. The need of a robust reconstruction method without the use of calibration artefacts is therefore arised.</p><br>
            
            <p style="MARGIN: 0px 16px 0px">The objectives of the thesis are (i) to develop a versatile method to reconstruct scenes and objects in three-dimensions without using any calibration artefact, (ii) to produce an accurate and detailed computational algorithm for the reconstruction as specified in (i), and (iii) to conduct a number of proof-of-principle 
experiments on real scenes and objects.</p><br>

			<p style="MARGIN: 0px 16px 0px">The outcomes of the work have shown that</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>The developed method proved that without camera calibration, the reconstruction work is much more simple than conventional, and the sensitivity of the reconstruction results to environmental changes, which mainly comes from the calibration process, is reduced.</li><br>
              <li>A sequence of images is recorded by a semi-professional camera in such a way that the target object/surface is clearly seen from different camera poses.</li><br>
              <li>An error analysis, which showed a small systematic error of the proposed algorithm, estimated from several synthetic scenarios, was done. </li><br>
              <li>The method was applied in the reconstruction of a flat surface of a plate and of a part of an aircraft wing surface. The final error of about 1 part in 1000 of the surface size was achieved.</li>
