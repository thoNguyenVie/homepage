This is done by reconstructing the spatially-varying modulus map of the whole domain using full-field optical strain data.  The reconstruction of modulus distributions is implemented through the newly developed Fourier-series-based Virtual Fields Method (F-VFM), taking advantage of deformation fields measured by an in-house high-resolution optical system.

            <p style="MARGIN: 0px 16px 0px">Inverse problems may arise in solid mechanics when the knowledge of either the material properties  or of the boundary conditions is restricted. Material parameters are often determined by implementing several standardised tests with the assumption that the stress or strain distributions within the testing region are uniform. However, if the materials under test exhibit spatial variations in these parameters, this approach is no longer viable.</p><br>
            <p style="MARGIN: 0px 16px 0px">The first method to solve such inverse problems is the efforts to find  analytical solutions to the fundamental equations in solid mechanics, through a massive number of sophisticated mathematical transformations. The method is limited by the requirement of <em>a priori</em> knowledge of the material properties.</p><br>
            <p style="MARGIN: 0px 16px 0px">Finite element model updating (FEMU) is another method to solve inverse problems by adjusting iteratively an approximate finite element model until the responses it produces are as close to those acquired from experiments as possible, in a least-squares sense. The confidence of the  results obtained from a FEMU scheme may depend on several subjective factors such as which optimisation algorithm being used, initial estimate of the unknown vector, constraints of variables, maximum iterations allowed, etc.</p><br>
            
            <p style="MARGIN: 0px 16px 0px">An alternative approach to tackling inverse problems of this type is by using the Virtual Fields Method (VFM). The development of the VFM was inspired by a relevant interpretation of the equation of the virtual work principle. The advantage of the VFM compared to other methods is its ability to solve inverse problems without any iteration. The key feature in any application of the VFM is the selection of the virtual fields. We retain the basic concepts underlying of the VFM but approach the parameterisation of unknown quantities in the spatial frequency, rather than spatial, domain by performing a 2-D Fourier series expansion of the unknown quantities over the region of interest. Successful applications of this Fourier-based VFM (denoted throughout by F-VFM) in the identification of a range of different stiffness distributions scenarios (in both 2-D and 3-D) have demonstrated its capabilities, for the case where the boundary conditions are either specified or unspecified.</p>
            <br>

			<p style="MARGIN: 0px 16px 0px">The outcomes of the work have shown that:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>Novel choice of the virtual fields as simple cosine/ sine functions in the F-VFM enables a computationally efficient algorithm by taking advantage of the fast Fourier transforms of the input data, which indeed is able to solve a thousand-degree-of-freedom problem within several seconds, or about 6 orders of magnitude of computational time less than that of an iterative model updating technique.</li>
			  <br>
              <li>If information of the boundary conditions over the perimeter (2-D) or bounding surfaces (3-D) of the domain of interest is provided, reconstruction of modulus is achieved at its real scale. However, in reality of experimental mechanics, such information is not accurately measured or even impossible to measure (e.g. in soft materials). In this case, the modulus will be reconstructed up to a scale factor by using one of the three approaches, namely the 'experimental traction', the 'windowed traction' and the 'Fourier-series traction' approaches.</li><br>
              <li>Even when the displacement noise is higher than in typical experimental fields, the accuracy of the modulus identification is still within an acceptable range of up to ~&plusmn;1%.
              </li><br>
              <li>The F-VFM has successfully been applied to 2-D and 3-D problems, using numerical (discontinuous-modulus pattern, 'egg-box' pattern, Gaussian pattern, plate with rectangular inclusion, circular disc in Hertz contact conditions, etc) and experimental data (discontinuous-modulus pattern, cube with spherical inclusion, circular disc in Hertz contact conditions, etc), with and without knowledge of the boundary conditions.</li>
